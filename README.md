- 👋 Hi, I’m @ter-bino
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (Ofcourse)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java's Swing library and making any projects I could think of to practice my skills in programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small Java projects. Well, not really but maybe.
- 📫 How to reach me ...? Well you probably don't need to reach me.
